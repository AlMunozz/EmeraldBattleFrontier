Pokémon Battle Frontier Companion – Project Description
This project is a complete web app focused on the Battle Frontier from Pokémon Emerald. The main idea is to provide players with a modern, clean, and easy-to-use interface. They can explore data, create teams, make notes, check progress, and calculate damage. It has everything they need to master the Battle Frontier. The design features a dark, elegant look that adjusts to users, making the experience smoother and more visually appealing.

Pokémon Database Page
The first section is the Pokémon database. Here, users can view all the Pokémon available in the Battle Frontier, including every set, variation, and possible build. Each Pokémon is presented in a clear table format that includes its item, nature, EVs, moves, and stats. A small but significant feature is the color-coding; stats with higher values appear in red, catching the user’s attention. This isn’t just for looks; it helps players quickly see which builds are optimized for speed, attack, or bulk.
Everything is interactive. When you click on a Pokémon or one of its builds, you’ll see a detailed view that expands all the information, including ability, held item, move descriptions, EV spread justification, and notes explaining the purpose of that set.

Team Builder
The second page is the team builder, one of the key features of this project. Here, users can create teams of up to three Pokémon, just like in the Battle Frontier. The process is straightforward and follows all official Pokémon mechanics: a Pokémon can have a maximum of 31 IVs per stat, up to 252 EVs max in one stat, and a total of 510 EVs in total.
Users can add Pokémon manually with a detailed editor that resembles a simplified version of Pokémon Showdown. You can select species, level, nature, moves, EVs, IVs, and the held item. For those who don't want to input every stat, importing is quick. You can paste a Pokémon Showdown team export directly and have your full team ready in seconds. Once your team is set, you can name it, reorder the Pokémon, edit details, and clone sets. You can also click on each member for a detailed view. Each team can be saved and loaded easily, allowing you to maintain different ones for various facilities like the Battle Tower and Battle Dome.

Notes Page
The third page is for notes. Some players might find useful writing down observations, tips, strategies, or enemy patterns. This section functions like a personal notebook built into the app. Each note can be titled and saved for later reference. Clicking on a note expands it to show the full text, allowing for editing or deletion at any time.

This feature helps organize small findings such as “Frontier Brain’s Starmie always opens with Thunder Wave” or “Use Calm Mind Latios to counter Physical Tyranitar.” It may seem simple, but it makes a big difference for dedicated players aiming to master Frontier challenges.

Symbol Checklist and Progress Tracker
No Battle Frontier experience is complete without the thrill of collecting symbols. The fourth page is a checklist that lets users mark off each Silver and Gold Symbol they’ve earned. The interface includes a progress chart that visually shows how far the player is from full completion, updating automatically as new achievements are marked.
A practical detail: when a Gold Symbol is checked, the Silver one is marked automatically, since it’s impossible to earn Gold without earning Silver first. This automation reduces confusion and adds a touch of polish.

Damage Calculator
The final major feature is the damage calculator. Every serious competitive player knows how crucial this tool is. Users can import Pokémon directly from Showdown or select them manually from the database for simulations. The calculator takes into account all relevant factors: critical hits, weather effects, field boosts, hazards like Spikes, held items, ability modifiers, and anything else affecting damage. After inputting the variables, it displays damage ranges in percentages, average rolls, and even the chance of scoring a knockout, such as “75% chance to KO in 2 hits.”
The display is compact yet filled with information, helping players grasp not just what happens but why. It bridges the gap between theory and practice in battles, fostering a deeper understanding of how builds interact. Pretty useful for players seeking long streaks and world records.

Design and User Experience
Every page in the web app follows a consistent visual style: dark mode, minimalist design, and smooth interface transitions. The color palette is neutral, using dark blue, grays, and a few accent colors, ensuring focus stays on the content instead of the decoration. The responsive design works on any device, so whether users are on a PC, tablet, or mobile, the experience remains consistent and elegant.
Animations are subtle, featuring smooth hovering and graceful transitions, just enough to give the app a lively feel without being distracting. The UI prioritizes readability and quick access, ensuring everything is in its right place.
